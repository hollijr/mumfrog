        <p>Mumfrog.com is a personal site that shares a little bit about me:&nbsp; Janet Hollier.  &nbsp;It provides a window into my software development world by highlighting the projects I've worked on since graduating in 2010 from the University of Washington.  It also captures useful tips and techniques that I've learned over the years, particularly those that I am likely to reuse on new projects.  For additional fun, Mumfrog includes some non-technical (artsy-crafty) creations that might appeal to fellow artsy-crafters.</p>
        <p>So who am I?  Well, that would be...</p>
        <p><span class="emphasis">...a happy wife</span>.  I met my husband many years ago while working in France where we were both writing internal software systems for NCR Corporation.  He's a tech-nerd superhero with mad skills.  My goal is to code like him.</p>
        <p><span class="emphasis">...a proud mom of eight</span> (including my four-legged kids).  Three amazing and talented children, two boisterous dogs and three fluffy cats.  (Yes, we vacuum a lot.)</p>
        <p><span class="emphasis">...a software and web developer</span>.  My passion for coding ignited over thirty years ago and has only grown stronger with time.  I appreciate and, therefore, strive to write clean, efficient code, and to this end, I am always working to improve my skills.  Writing code is my favorite creative outlet and at times, is even therapeutic.  You know what they say about a tired dog being a happy dog?  Well, a tired-from-hours-of-coding Janet is a happy Janet!</p>
        <p><span class="emphasis">...a college instructor</span>.  During the last two years, I taught object-oriented programming and web development courses at two community colleges.  Teaching is fantastic -- grading is not!</p>
        <p><span class="emphasis">...a student</span>.  <i>"Never stop learning!"</i> &nbsp;Though I've graduated college twice (Decision Sciences B.S. and Computer Science B.S.), I just can't seem to get enough education.  Online courses and tutorials are the best thing since sliced bread!  I am now working my way through the catalog of courses offered by udacity.com. </p>
        <p><span class="emphasis">...a tinkerer</span>.  With so many new and evolving software development tools available, I like to create little projects that let me try the new things out -- to 'learn by doing'.  Yeah, ok, so sometimes I'm like, <i>"Squirrel!"</i> and bounce from one new project to another, but who can blame me when there are so-o-o many fun, new things explore!  (Personally, I blame my husband.  He's the enabler... :) &nbsp; My latest adventure involves a little Arduino MKR1000, some temp sensors and a Nest thermostat.</p>
        <p><span class="emphasis">...a pseudo-artist</span>.  Though I would never claim to be a <i>true</i> artist, I do have an artistic eye that enables me to design user interfaces and and create the graphics needed for my projects.</p>

        <p>So why Mumfrog.com instead of the more logical JanetHollier.com? <br>(Yes, the latter is more obvious and therefore, probably better -- so I should probably go lock up that domain before someone else grabs it, huh?)</p>
        <p>Aside from being fewer letters to type, 'Mumfrog'' pays homage to my silent (or should I say "mum") teammate and constant desk companion -- my ceramic frog buddy who steadfastly holds my writing implements, smiles benignly at me while I bang my head in frustration against my computer monitor and never utters a word of reproach when there's a bug in my code.  (Being a frog, it doesn't complain about bugs, it just eats them.)</p>
