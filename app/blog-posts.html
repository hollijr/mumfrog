After recently adopting three indoor cats from the local Humane Society, our home has gone from needing to be vacuumed twice a week to almost daily.  And since we don't want to spend more time vacuuming by hand, my husband and I decided to purchase a robotic vacuum to handle the increased workload.   As it turned out, we brought home two different vacuums:  the iRobot Roomba 595 Pet Vacuum and the Neato XV-21 Pet and Allergy Vacuum.

<h3>The Companies</h3>
</div>
iRobot was founded in 1990 by some roboticists from MIT.  Since this company is known for making robots  that are used by the military to dispose of bombs (<a href="http://www.irobot.com/us/robots/defense/packbot.aspx">http://www.irobot.com/us/robots/defense/packbot.aspx</a>),  we figured they should be able to make a pretty good vacuum.  Neato (<a href="http://www.neatorobotics.com">http://www.neatorobotics.com</a>) , on the other hand, focuses specifically on floor cleaning robots.   They came to the market after looking at what was available and deciding it could be done in a better way.

<div id="impressions_hdr">
<h3>Out-of-the-Box Impressions</h3>
</div>
Inside their outer cardboard boxes, both vacuums came wrapped in bubble wrap.  Neato's packaging was rather innovative in that it's bubble wrap was sturdily formed to fit the shape of the vacuum.  Also, we liked that Neato's accessories all came packaged together so that they were quick and easy to find.

The vacuums are similar in size: approximately 13" x 13" x 3" but differ in shape, with Roomba being round while the Neato is more like a filled "U".  Both vacuums have a "forward" edge that depresses so that the vacuum gives when it hits an obstacle.

<div id="accessories_hdr">
<h3>Accessories</h3>
</div>
Our Roomba and Neato came with many of the same accessories: a home base charging station, a brief Quick Start guide as well as a more detailed (and multi-language) user guide, and an accessory that you can use to keep the vacuum from going where you don't want it to go.
<ul>
	<li>For Roomba, this accessory is called a Virtual Wall<strong><sup>®</sup></strong> (two included) and it emits an invisible beam through which the Roomba cannot pass.  The beam will cover up to a seven foot wide opening.  As it gets farther from the base unit, the beam spreads out to form a cone shape rather than a narrow line so you have to position the unit to account for this shape (which takes a bit of trial and error since you can't see the beam).  The units are small, unobtrusive, and can be set to auto mode so that you can leave them in place rather than having to set them out and pick them up each time Roomba cleans.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Neato uses a magnetic boundary marker for restricting its movement.  The marker (strip) is placed on the floor and Neato will not cross over it.  The vacuum came with a 13' strip that can be cut into smaller pieces and you can order more from their website as needed.  The strips are nice because they clearly delineate where Neato will not be able to go but the downside is that you have to lay them out before and pick them up after Neato's cleaning cycle.</li>
</ul>
<div><a href="http://www.flitfire.com/tech/robotic-vacuum-wars-roomba-vs-neato-page-2/restricters/" rel="attachment wp-att-172"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-172" title="restricters" src="http://www.flitfire.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/restricters.jpg" alt="photo of virtual wall unit and Neato boundary marker" width="600" height="334" /></a></div>
Roomba also included three replacement filters with the vacuum while Neato came with a two brushes --  a bristle "pet &amp; allergy" brush and a standard brush that has solid, flexible blades.   Although we didn't do so, you can optionally purchase a remote control for Roomba as well as a unit called the Virtual Wall Halo that creates a buffer around your pet's food and water bowls so that the Roomba will not bump into them (and potentially cause spills).  Both vacuums offer replacement parts for purchase on their web sites.
<div id="charging_hdr">
<h3>Charging</h3>
Not surprisingly, you need to charge both vacuums completely before their first use.  (Actually, our Roomba arrived with a bit of residual charge so we were able to satisfy our initial curiosity and run it for a minute or two before having to charge it.)

You can charge Roomba in one of two ways.  Plug the charging station's power cord into a nearby outlet, set the Roomba over the station's contact strip and make sure the color of the vacuum's LED changes to indicate that it's charging.  Alternatively, you can skip the charging station and just plug the power cord directly into the Roomba.  Our Roomba was fully charged within two hours.

Neato only charges using its charging station, which (similar to Roomba) should be placed against a wall and have at least three feet of clearance to the front and sides.  Neato's rounded side is placed against the front of the charging station so that the two raised contact strips on the station are depressed.

(Note:  When we first set Neato up to charge, nothing happened.  A quick look inside the station revealed that the power cord had detached from its interior plug and after reconnecting it, the charging station powered up properly.)
<div id="interface_hdr"><h3>Interface</h3></div>
Roomba's interface uses colored LED lights, a digital clock display, and different sounds to tell you what it is doing.  Also, there are eight buttons on top of the vacuum used for setting the clock and selecting cleaning mode.

Like Roomba, Neato's interface includes the use of colored lights, sounds and buttons but it adds an LCD panel, which makes communicating with Neato more intuitive and user friendly.  The LCD displays messages to guide you through setup (e.g., clock, scheduling) and to inform you of Neato's current state (e.g., charging, returning to charge, cleaning, stuck and needs assistance, etc.). During setup, you can select the language for the display using menu navigation buttons located beside the LCD panel.
<div id="howitcleans_hdr">
<h3>How It Cleans</h3>
</div>
Roomba's cleaning system uses an edge-cleaning brush on one side to pull dirt under the unit where two counter-rotating brushes, in combination with vacuum suction, scoop the dirt up into the dirt bin.  Neato uses one wide rotating brush and has no edge brushes.  It relies on strong suction to pick up debris.

Both Roomba and Neato have the same three cleaning modes: general, spot and scheduled.  General and scheduled modes are synonymous in that the vacuums clean everywhere they can reach; the only difference is that general mode is started manually while as the name suggests, scheduled mode starts automatically based on a start time you specify.  Spot cleaning mode is also started manually but the vacuums only clean a small area around where they are started.

<h3>Our Cleaning Experiences...</h3>
</div>
<div id="general_hdr">
<h4>...In General</h4>
</div>
Other than when spot cleaning, our Roomba generally travels in a line until it hits something, at which point it rotates slightly and heads off in a new direction.  It makes several passes in every direction, covering some areas many, many times and others only once or twice.  It often runs along the walls or fronts of cabinets for a while before inexplicably turning and crossing the room.  When it goes over a particularly dirty area, Roomba will stop and take a spin or two around that spot to get it clean before continuing on its way, which is pretty clever. But its cleaning approach seems inefficient to us and its randomness makes us wonder if Roomba actually does go over every space, especially if we leave doors open so that Roomba can head off into another room before finishing the current room. The guide says that for most efficient cleaning, you should restrict the Roomba to one room at a time but for us, having to move Roomba from room to room within a cleaning cycle greatly reduces the benefit of using a robotic vacuum.

%CODE1%

Neato, on the other hand, maps a room on startup by first scanning to locate and move to a nearby wall, then going along the room's perimeter until it reaches its starting point again.  At that point, Neato makes slightly overlapping passes back and forth (as you would if you were mowing your lawn) to make sure it cleans all the space within the boundaries it mapped.  Neato has the ability to detect doorways so that it will automatically map and clean one room (or section of a room, depending on furniture layout) at a time before moving on to the next.   We like this feature and the intentional, predictable cleaning pattern Neato follows.  However, Neato only goes over its pattern once during a cleaning cycle.  Sometimes, one pass provides sufficient cleaning (particularly on wood floors) but other times, Neato leaves debris behind (particularly in the transitions from carpet to hard floor) so we have to send it on a second cleaning cycle after it completes its first.   It would be nice if we could reverse its cleaning direction on the second pass.

<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/R85MLQ6o9dg" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315" ></iframe>

Occasionally Roomba also has trouble picking up heavier debris or cat hair that's stuck to the carpeting.  On the whole, though, both Roomba and Neato pick up debris effectively, especially if you judge by the amount of dirt that fills their bins after a cleaning.  Roomba's counter-rotating brushes and multiple passes over the same area undoubtedly help it clean well but the latter also means that Roomba always takes longer to clean a room than Neato.

When going full speed, Roomba is still relatively quiet (similar to a box fan running on low-to-medium speed).  We found the Neato to be a little bit louder than Roomba, perhaps due to stronger suction, and that it ran out of charge sooner than the Roomba.  (Neato ran for 30 minutes and Roomba for 90 minutes before their batteries needed recharging.)  How far either vacuum gets on a single charge will vary based on the number of obstacles it has to work around, the thickness of the carpeting, etc.  When it did run low on charge, Neato did not have any trouble returning to its charging station and automatically docking.  After recharging, it auto-powered back up and completed cleaning, picking up where it left off.

Note: Neato struggled somewhat when working on thicker carpeting (1/2" pile) with the pet brush installed.  Its motor worked very hard, causing it to use up its charge faster, and it began clicking.  We replaced the pet brush with the standard brush, after which the clicking stopped and the motor revved less.

Roomba will also find its way back to its charging station once it has finished vacuuming or if it begins to run low on charge but unlike the Neato, which keeps a map to its base station in memory, our Roomba is only able to return to its home base when it can detect a clear path to it.  When its battery needs recharging, Roomba's LED turns orange and the 'Dock' button starts flashing green.  If, at that point, it is too far away to find its home, we either have to pick it up and carry it back or we herd it toward to a direct path using the Virtual Wall units.  Neither way is ideal.

We initially ran both vacuums in a room that contained three counter stools and a small table with two chairs so there were lots of legs to navigate. Roomba had a very difficult time with the chairs and stools, ping-ponging from one leg to another, and was not able to clean around them efficiently.  After removing the chairs and stools, Roomba was able to navigate just the table legs well enough.

Our Neato was able to navigate around the stools and chairs more efficiently but like the Roomba, it works much better when they are removed.  When necessary, Neato will automatically lift its backend up to help it maneuver out of tight areas.  However, Neato did get stuck a couple of times where the Roomba did not, notably 1) under a bookcase because Neato has a raised "scanning eye" on top that makes it taller than the Roomba and 2) under an air vent cover that Neato pushed up against a table leg, then got wedged under.  Once stuck, Neato displayed a message to let us know it needed help getting unstuck.
<div id="scheduling_hdr">
<h4>...With Scheduling</h4>
</div>
Setting a scheduled cleaning time on either vacuum is easy  and both allow you to schedule one cleaning per day, seven days a week and will repeat the scheduled time(s) unless you remove it (them). Roomba lets us schedule down to the minute while Neato only schedules on the quarter-hour.

I scheduled a test run on each and at its schedule time, each vacuum powered up by itself and began cleaning.  Both vacuums ran low on battery power before finishing the scheduled cleaning but only Neato was able to return to its base station to recharge without assistance.   Once recharged, it powered back up and completed the job.  I don't know about Roomba -- it ran so long on its first charge that I had to leave before it completed recharging, and because I didn't want it running while I was not home to monitor it, I cancelled the remainder of the scheduled job.

The following two videos show Roomba and Neato performing a scheduled clean over a small, restricted area (about 12' x 8').

Video condensed to 1:03 minutes.</dd></dl></div>
<div id="spot_hdr">
<h4>...On the Spot</h4>
</div>
While both Neato and Roomba provide a spot cleaning mode, they work differently.

Roomba spot cleans in a circle around its starting point, spiraling out in overlapping but increasingly larger circles until it reaches a diameter of about 3.5' feet.  Then it begins to decrease the size of its circles, spiraling inward back to original starting position, and powers down.
<div class="video"><dl id="attachment_107" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 430px;"><dt class="wp-caption-dt"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jSFPpWbZCUc" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></dt><dd class="wp-caption-dd">In a spot clean test with one ounce of barley grains, Roomba left behind quite a few seeds, in part because its fast-rotating edge brush scattered them. (Video shown at 2.35x original speed.)</dd></dl></div>
Neato spot cleans in the shape of a 6' x 4' rectangle.  From its starting position, Neato outlines the perimeter of the rectangle in front of it, then lines up at one end of the perimeter and goes back and forth lengthwise until it has cleaned the area within the perimeter.  Neato then returns to its starting position and powers down.

<div id="cost_hdr">
<h3>Cost and Other Features</h3>
</div>
We purchased the Roomba from Costco for $299.  Roomba's other features include cliff detection to keep it from falling off stairs, dirt detection (i.e., the spinning movement described earlier) to automatically intensify its cleaning effort in dirtier areas, and an anti-tangle system that reverses Roomba's brushes to unravel any cords or tassels that it sucks up.

Neato can also sense drop offs so that it won't fall down stairs.  Unlike Roomba, though, it doesn't have special dirt detection or an anti-tangle feature so you need to secure or remove cords, cables, tassels and the like before vacuuming.  Both vacuums automatically adjust to changes in flooring height.

We purchased our Neato at Best Buy for $380 (minus our Silver Rewards discount).  Though it is significantly more expensive than the Roomba, Neato lets you upgrade its firmware using a USB port on the side of the vacuum, so you can potentially get performance improvements without having to buy a new vacuum.
<div id="maintenance_hdr">
<h3>Maintenance</h3>
</div>
Maintenance of both vacuums is very similar:  After each cleaning cycle, you need to remove and clean the dirt bin and air filter and ensure that the rotating brushes are free from hair and other debris. These parts are easy to access and both user guides provide easy-to-follow instructions on  how to remove and clean them.  The wheels and cliff/drop sensors also need to be cleaned periodically to ensure the vacuum is able to operate properly. Roomba's guide recommends replacing the air filter every two months while Neato's guide recommends replacement every three to six months of typical use.   Both guides recommend that you keep the vacuum charging in its base station when not in use in order to prolong battery life.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
</div>
While in many ways, Roomba and Neato are very similar, and both provide some unique features that we like as well as some that we could do without.  Ideally, there will one-day be a reasonably priced 'super vacuum' whose design incorporates the best features from both these vacuums:

From Roomba,
<ul>
	<li>counter-rotating and edge brushes</li>
	<li>dirt detection</li>
	<li>anti-tangle system</li>
	<li>double passes over the area</li>
</ul>
From Neato,
<ul>
	<li>strong suction</li>
	<li>room mapping</li>
	<li>intelligent cleaning pattern</li>
	<li>door detection to clean one room at a time</li>
	<li>upgradable firmware</li>
	<li>self-raising backend for maneuverability</li>
</ul>
It would also be nice to include a small brush especially designed to clean the air filter and/or a washable air filter.

Until then, though, both robots do a good job and running either one daily will definitely help keep the floors clean.  Obviously, they aren't a complete replacement for manual vacuuming since there are always areas that they can't reach.  But they are great for doing the daily once-over to help keep the house looking nice.  Overall, which one is better?  Personally, I preferred the Neato but in the end, we decided to keep both vacuums -- one for upstairs and one for downstairs -- because their different strengths suit the specific characteristics of the rooms they now call home.
